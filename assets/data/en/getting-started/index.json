This minimizes human intervention and implements ambient agent philosophy, ensuring that agents operate with maximally automated processes so that humans do not become productivity constraints.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible and Powerful Multi-Agent Collaboration</strong>: Process GPT is configured so that <strong>multiple AI agents collaborate within a single workflow</strong>, professionally handling complex tasks and sharing intermediate results to reliably automate high-complexity work that would be difficult for a single agent. Each agent utilizes specialized domain knowledge and tools, and can call upon other specialized agents to delegate tasks when necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Language-Based Continuous Process Learning and Optimization</strong>: It enables business users without specialized knowledge to <strong>define business processes in natural language</strong>, automating the creation of initial process models. Additionally, it analyzes user feedback or system logs on agent-performed results to continuously improve processes, and establishes an <strong>automatic optimization cycle</strong> that strengthens learning data for work that went down incorrect paths to improve them next time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"design-principles\"><a href=\"#design-principles\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Design Principles</h2>\n<p>Users should be able to declare and modify processes, rules, system integration mechanisms, etc. in natural language, and the system should automatically improve with minimal feedback provided during use.<br>\nAll such changes should be logged for traceability and recovery, while users should be able to directly control automation results and regulations at any time through a generalized UI.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"principle-1-natural-language-centric-definition-and-unlearning-based-operation\"><a href=\"#principle-1-natural-language-centric-definition-and-unlearning-based-operation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Principle 1. Natural Language-Centric Definition and Unlearning-Based Operation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All <strong>process definitions, rules, system integrations, and business screens</strong> must be writable in <strong>natural language</strong> without requiring programming knowledge or complex logical/mathematical thinking.  </li>\n<li>Users should be able to design automation with only <strong>business goal or strategic-level descriptions</strong> without going through separate training processes.  </li>\n<li>The system should progressively refine and manage itself with only <strong>minimal feedback (approval, modification, rejection)</strong> provided during actual usage.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"principle-2-human-in-the-loop-and-exemplars-based-learning\"><a href=\"#principle-2-human-in-the-loop-and-exemplars-based-learning\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Principle 2. Human in the Loop and Exemplars-Based Learning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated agents must always provide a <strong>human interface</strong> that allows <strong>human takeover</strong> at any time.  </li>\n<li>Each task should clearly provide the <strong>necessary context (related data, previous step outputs, similar cases)</strong> to make it easy for humans to process.  </li>\n<li>Agents learn from <strong>actual execution examples</strong> performed directly by humans to correct and improve their execution knowledge. In other words, <strong>human exemplars</strong> become the agent's training data.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"principle-3-automatic-compensation-and-separation-of-recovery-responsibility\"><a href=\"#principle-3-automatic-compensation-and-separation-of-recovery-responsibility\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Principle 3. Automatic Compensation and Separation of Recovery Responsibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When errors or failures occur during agent-executed automation processes, <strong>automatic recovery should be performed through compensating transactions (rollback)</strong>.  </li>\n<li>Operators should not need to individually track and modify the detailed actions of agents; <strong>the system itself should take responsibility for handling failure recovery</strong>.  </li>\n<li>Through this approach, users are freed from system imperfections, and overall business continuity is guaranteed.</li>\n</ul>\n","sidebar":"getting-started","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Process-GPT Introduction","anchor":"#process-gpt-introduction"},{"depth":2,"value":"Process-GPT Core Values","anchor":"#process-gpt-core-values"},{"depth":2,"value":"Design Principles","anchor":"#design-principles"},{"depth":3,"value":"Principle 1.
