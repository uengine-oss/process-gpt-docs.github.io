# Customer-Customized Newsletter Process Running with Multiple Instances

## ProcessGPT Tutorial Lv.5 Followed by VIP Newsletter Process

This tutorial guides you through the process of writing and sending customer-customized newsletters by **AI agent** and customer data connection.  
The agent creates a newsletter customized to the customer's interests and level based on the collected VIP information, and runs the same process simultaneously for each customer through the multiple instance feature.  
Therefore, each customer can automatically receive the customized newsletter optimized for themselves.  
The generated draft is automatically sent when approved through the review process, and the result can also be checked individually by customer unit.
