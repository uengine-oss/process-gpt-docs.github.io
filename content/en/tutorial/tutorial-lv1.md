By clicking the proposal writing process, you can view the defined process, and validate or execute the process through the simulation mode.
![](../../../uengine-image/process-gpt/en/tutorial/lv-1/lv1-5-5.png)

By clicking 'Execute', you can view the first step of the proposal writing process, and after assigning roles and entering results, you can click 'Submit Complete' to execute the process.<br>
At this time, role assignment can be made by a user who has joined ProcessGPT or a registered Agent. <br>

Result input can be manually entered or generated by AI through 'Delegate to Agent' to create appropriate input values for the process.

By clicking 'Submit Complete', the process will be executed, and the following results can be checked. <br>
![](../../../uengine-image/process-gpt/en/tutorial/lv-1/lv1-5-8.png)
1. Instance <br>
    When the process is executed, the executed process is registered in the instance, and detailed information can be checked by clicking.

2. Kanban Board <br>
    By clicking the 'Kanban Board' tab of the proposal writing process, you can check the status of work items registered in the process based on the Kanban board.
    For tasks in progress and expected tasks, the tasks corresponding to your lane are displayed.

After clicking the proposal writing step, it is created as shown below, and the information entered in the previous step can be checked.

By proceeding with 'Delegate to Agent', ProcessGPT automatically connects each step through AI to create a result with a connection based on the information received from the previous steps through **Prompt Chaining** and **Context Engineering** that automatically extracts the necessary information from each step and passes it to the next step.
