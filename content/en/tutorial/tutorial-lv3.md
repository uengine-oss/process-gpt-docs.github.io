# Condition Branch Setting and Feedback Reflection

## ProcessGPT Tutorial Lv.3 Followed by Sales Activity Process

This tutorial guides you through the process of correcting and supplementing a sales proposal draft written by **AI agent** according to the feedback from the sales team manager. 
When writing a proposal, simple review such as typos, missing attachments, and customer request implementation is performed by the agent, and review requiring strategic judgment is performed by the sales team manager.


### Process Modification
