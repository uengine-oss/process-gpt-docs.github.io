# Voice-based ProcessGPT

## Voice Chat-Based ProcessGPT

**Voice-based ProcessGPT** is a feature that provides a voice-based response to the user's request in real-time through a web socket interface with a shortened interface delay based on the information created in the tenant.<br>

Voice-based ProcessGPT can easily understand the complex process information accumulated by answering the user's request by identifying the process list and todo list registered in the tenant.<br>
Additionally, when the user requests the process and requirements in voice, it can create detailed task definitions and detailed contents based on it.


### Process List View

The method of checking the process list created by voice chat is as follows.

Click the chat icon at the top to enter the chat screen, and check if Assistant has been created. If it hasn't been created, check if the screen below appears by adding System as a participant through chat room creation.<br>
