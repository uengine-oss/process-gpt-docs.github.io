# Multi Agent

## MCP-based Multi Agent Automatic Draft Creation

Multi Agent is a system that automatically analyzes and implements the optimal solution for complex tasks through MCP(Model Context Protocol) integrated multi-agent, enabling autonomous problem solving.

Specialized AI agents automatically form teams based on business requirements, perform projects in their specialized fields, and solve problems flexibly through delegation and inquiry between agents to achieve their goals independently. <br>
Furthermore, through MCP, hundreds of business tools such as internal document search, Office tools, databases, cloud services, etc. are connected through a single interface, allowing agents to access all company systems like actual employees, from CRM analysis to report writing, schedule management, and department collaboration, shortening the time it takes to complete tasks that previously took days and ensuring specialization through the use of various tools by agents.
